## Packages/Dependencies

- Parcel-bundler (Build tool/bundler)
- SASS (SCSS) (Stylesheet)
- SrollReveal (Animation library)

## Scripts

- `npm install`: Install dev dependencies
- `npm run dev`: Run development live server
- `npm build`: Compile code for production

**Please Note:**

> The latest stable version of SASS was used, which replaced _`import`_ with _`use`_ and _`forward`_. Therefore, `import` is not supported and using IDE extensions to compile won't work.
